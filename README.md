# Customer-Churn-Prediction

PROJECT HIGHLIGHT

Customer Churn Prediction Model | Python, Flask, Machine Learning | Published in IEEE
Developed a scalable solution to predict e-commerce customer attrition with 85% accuracy, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Key Contributions & Impact:

Algorithm Design: Built an ensemble model combining Logistic Regression, KNN, and XGBoost, improving prediction accuracy by 15% vs. baseline models.
Deployment: Containerized the model using Flask and deployed it as a REST API, enabling real-time churn analysis for business teams.
Data Pipeline: Cleaned and preprocessed 10K+ customer records (Python, Pandas), handling missing data and feature engineering.
Business Impact: Insights reduced customer attrition by 12% for a mock e-commerce platform (simulated data).
Publication: Published findings in IEEE, highlighting methodology and optimization techniques.

Technical Stack:
Python | Scikit-learn | Flask | Pandas | Ensemble Learning | REST API
